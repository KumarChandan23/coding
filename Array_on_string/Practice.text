Reverse a String:
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. For example, if the input is "hello," the function should return "olleh."

Check for Palindrome:
Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequences of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

Count Vowels and Consonants:
Create a function that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels and consonants in the string.

Find the Longest Word:

Count Occurrences of a Substring:
Write a function that takes a string and a substring as input and counts the number of occurrences of the substring in the string.

String Compression:
Implement a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3."

Rotate String:
Write a function that rotates the characters of a string to the left by a given number of positions. For example, if the input is "abcdef" and the rotation is 2, the output should be "cdefab."
